						<h2>multiple employer plan</h2>
						
						<p class="sub-title">Keeping it simple makes it easy</p>

						<p>If you don’t think you have enough time, resources or know-how to include a retirement in your benefits package, consider the 401k ELITE Multiple Employer Plan (MEP)<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup>.  This affordable, full-featured program is engineered for simplicity. It helps simplify the role of the business owner.</p>

						<h3>What Is a MEP? <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=169790"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="pdf"></a></h3>
						<p>A MEP is a retirement savings package in which multiple businesses participate in a single qualified retirement plan. It is sponsored by a third party, referred to as the “MEP Sponsor,” that takes on the responsibility and liability for running the plan. A business that joins a MEP is referred to as an “Adopting Employer.” The 401k ELITE Multiple Employer Plan is funded by an unregistered group annuity contract issued by Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.</p>

					

						<h3>Save Time</h3>
						<p>Pentegra Services, Inc. serves as the plan sponsor and ERISA 3(16) plan administrator</p>
						<ul>
						<li>You’ll save staff time and it simplifies the day-to-day operations for your business.</li>
						<li>An investment manager takes care of the plan’s investment lineup.</li>
						<li>A plan record keeper provides access to participants’ accounts.</li>
						</ul>

						
						<h3>Reduce Fiduciary Responsibility and Liability</h3>
						<p>Mesirow Financial Investment Management, Inc. serves as the investment fiduciary. Fund selection, ongoing monitoring and replacement  of the plan’s investment lineup is the responsibility of Meisrow Financial.</p>
						
						<p><br/><i>Note: A MEP is not suit able for non-qualified plans, plans that are not fully compliant or those without all plan documents and prior testing reports.</i> </p>
