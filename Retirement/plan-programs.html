						<p class="sub-title">Retirement solutions that work for your business</p>

						<p>Be selective. Choose wisely. A retirement savings program should complement your business. At Ameritas, we will help you explore your options. <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=379624">Overview</a> <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=379624"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Overview" /></a></p>

						<h3>Traditional 401(k) <a href="401k-retirement-plan-faq.html"><img src="../img/icons/faq.jpg" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>It is the most popular employer sponsored retirement plan for private companies. Plan participants' can make pre-tax contributions.  Employers may choose to match their participants' contributions.</p>
						 
						<h3>Safe Harbor 401(k) <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=020146"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>This plan design gives highly compensated employees the ability to maximize their salary deferrals without the sometimes problematic nondiscrimination testing requirements. By providing a required employer contribution, a Safe Harbor 401(k) plan design has the potential to create more deferral opportunity and incent participants with an employer contribution.</p>
						

						<h3>Roth Option <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=014503"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>Both the traditional 401(k) and Safe Harbor 401(k) retirement plans can elect to offer the Roth 401(k) feature. Roth contributions are made on an after-tax basis and earnings grow tax-free. </p>

						<h3>Ameritas SoloPlus<sup>®</sup> <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=031595"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>This plan type is especially well suited for small businesses that employ only owners and their spouses and offers all the features available to larger employers.</p>

						<h3>Ameritas EZ(k)<sup>®</sup> <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=370594"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>Our streamlined program features a Safe Harbor 401(k) with key features found in more traditional retirement plans, yet is simple to implement and administer. </p>

						<h3>401k ELITE Multiple Employer Plan (MEP)<sup>®</sup> <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=169790"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>With this plan, unrelated businesses participate in a single qualified retirement plan sponsored by a third party. With our 401k ELITE MEP, a business can achieve the economies of scale typically only realized by larger plans.  It relieves the business owner of many of the time-consuming duties and responsibilities associated with sponsoring a plan.  It's cost-effective and reduces fiduciary responsibility and liability. </p>

						<h3>Advantage Advisory Program <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=375668"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>It brings together many of the plan design features found in a traditional 401(k) with something extra - five managed investment portfolios managed by affiliate Ameritas Investment Corp., a federally registered investment advisor firm, member FINRA/SIPC. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. provides the recordkeeping and compliance services.</p>

						<h3>New Comparability Plan <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=020145"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>Here is a plan that allows employers to maximize contributions to a targeted group.  There can be different benefit structures for different divisions. In order for such a plan to meet non-discrimination requirements, certain minimum contributions are required for all benefiting employees. </p>

						<h3>Cash Balance Plan <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=049391"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>This defined benefit plan operates similar to a profit sharing plan. The contribution is determined annually based on an actuarial calculation that takes into consideration an individual's current age and salary and years to retirement, typically age 65. </p>
						<p>Advantages include:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Plan sponsors can define their contributions</li>
						<li>Deductible contributions are substantially higher than in a defined contribution plan, such as a 401(k)</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>457(b) <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=020434"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Q&A" /></a></h3>
						<p>Employees of states, municipalities, political subdivisions or agencies can participate in this deferred compensation plan to save for retirement. </p>

						<p><br/>Which plan will work for you and your business? Our knowledgeable professionals can develop an appropriate plan and will assist in making the transition from your current provider.  Our experienced team offers a full range of services that includes plan conversion, key administrative functions and administrative support.</p>
