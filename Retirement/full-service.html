						<p class="sub-title">Making the most of your retirement plan</p>

						<p>As a full service provider, we can provide a wide variety of services needed to help plan sponsors adopt and maintain a retirement plan. These services bring value by helping retain current employees while attracting outstanding talent — the key to a successful and growing business. <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=379625">Overview</a> <a href="https://service.ameritas.com/OCM/GetFile?doc=379625"><img src="../img/icons/pdf.png" alt="Overview" /></a></p>

						<h3>Plan Documents</h3>

						<p>Be selective. Choose wisely. A retirement savings program should complement your business. At Ameritas, we will help you explore your options. And there are many.</p>

						<h3>Compliance</h3>

						<p>As a full service provider, Ameritas performs the day-to-day administrative functions that help plan sponsors maintain a tax-qualified retirement plan. This includes staying current on the required IRS regulations and Form 5500 reporting, as well as administrative duties, such as vesting calculation, eligibility calculations, distributions reporting, etc.</p>

						<h3>Safe Harbor 401(k)</h3>
						<p>This plan design gives highly compensated employees the ability to manage their salary deferrals without the sometimes problematic nondiscrimination testing requirements. By providing a required employer contribution, a Safe Harbor 401(k) plan design has the potential to create more deferral opportunity and incent participants with an employer contribution.</p>

						<h3>Recordkeeping</h3>
						<p>Ameritas provides individual and plan level account reporting and 24/7 transactional features to help participants manage their account based on their schedule.</p>

						<h3>Annual Plan Review</h3>
						<p>This review provides basic information about the plan. Reports include, but are not limited to: participant deferral averages by age group, participation by age group and withdrawal activity which helps plan sponsors understand how their participants are taking advantage of this employee benefit.</p>

						<h3>Fiduciary Assistance/Tools</h3>
						<p>These services include a Fiduciary Handbook that details the plan fiduciary’s responsibilities, Mesirow Financial 3(21) and 3(38) investment services, annual due diligence checklists and other tools that provide guidance for plan sponsors and administrators.</p>

						<h3>Participant Education</h3>
						<p>Our educational module – RetireFocus – provides videos, charts, tutorials and articles to help plan participants understand the value of their retirement plan and how they can use it to achieve their retirement savings goals.</p>

						<h3>Secure Account Access (24/7)</h3>
						<p>Participants can access their account any time to learn about saving for retirement as well as managing their account based on their needs and level of involvement.</p>

						<h3>Investment Services</h3>
						<p>From selection to monitoring and reporting, Ameritas has a wide range of investment services to assist the plan sponsor in creating an investment platform that provides participants with a diversified, high-quality investment lineup. </p>
