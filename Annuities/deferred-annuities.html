						<h2>deferred annuities</h2>
						
						<p class="sub-title">A solid foundation of stability and growth</p>
						<p>Imagine having stability and growth to guide you to your retirement goals. That's what you get with an annuity that's designed to give you the safety of a fixed interest rate and tax-deferral to watch your earnings grow and then to provide a steady stream of income when you retire.</p>

						<h3>Tax-Deferred Interest</h3>
						<p>When you purchase a deferred annuity, you will receive an initial interest rate that is locked in for a specific period of time, depending on the products available and the choices you select. After the initial rate, your annuity will renew at a competitive interest rate based on current economic conditions.</p>

						<p>Earnings in annuities grow tax-deferred, which means you won’t pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw your money, usually at retirement. You benefit from this tax-deferred compounding because the earnings that would be lost to taxes each year remain in the annuity to generate additional earnings.</p>

						<h3>Income Stream</h3>
						<p>When you are ready to receive income from your annuity, we can automatically deposit current interest earnings to your checking account. Perhaps, you'll decide to annuitize, which means you choose from available payment schedules that fit your need. By receiving annuitized payments, you spread any income tax liability over a longer period of time and could be guaranteed income for life.</p>

						<p>Even if you’re not ready to receive regular payments from your annuity, you may be able to access a portion of the annuity value without a company penalty. Keep in mind when earnings are withdrawn, they are taxed as ordinary income and individuals under the age of 59½ may be charged IRS penalties.</p>

						<p>A deferred annuity might be right for you if you're looking for fixed interest rate, tax-deferred growth and income when you retire.</p>
