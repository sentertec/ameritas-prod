						<h2>annuities</h2>
						<p class="sub-title">Prepare for retirement and more</p>
						<p>Most of us can expect to live a long, healthy life—well into our 80s and beyond. That’s the good news. But to live life to its fullest you have to be financially prepared. At Ameritas, we believe it’s possible to be prepared for retirement. And annuities can help. </p>
						
						<p>An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company which provides for future income payments in exchange for your investment now.  Annuities are long-term savings vehicles designed to grow and protect your money leading up to retirement and then to turn that money into an income stream you cannot outlive. </p>
						
						<h3>Ways to Use an Annuity</h3>
						<p>If you're already contributing the maximum to other retirement plans, like an IRA or 401(k), an annuity is an attractive retirement planning option that grows tax-deferred. You can also use annuities to provide a current source of income—both before or during retirement. Annuities can help you achieve a variety of financial goals.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Extra Income Needs &mdash; Fill the gap between early retirement and the beginning of Social Security benefits or provide more during the early, more active years of retirement</li>
							<li>Business Needs &mdash; Establish and fund personal individual retirement accounts or retirement savings accounts to attract and retain skilled employees</li>
							<li>Non-retirement Needs &mdash; Provide reliable, regular income such as payments to college students to cover living expenses</li>
							<li>Retirement Needs &mdash; Provide for essential expenses in retirement not covered by Social Security, pension plans or personal savings</li>
						</ul>
						
						
						<p>While you can learn more about our products on this website, this information is no substitute for the guidance and assistance you'll get by meeting with a qualified financial professional.  To learn more about being financially prepared for your future, contact a professional today.</p>
