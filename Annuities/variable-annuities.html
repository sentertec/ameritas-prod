						<h2>variable annuities</h2>
						<p class="sub-title">Prepare for the future</h3>
						<p>At Ameritas we believe it’s possible to be prepared for retirement. Variable annuities can help you get there. They provide growth potential and can be a guaranteed source of income. They can be an integral part of your long-term retirement planning strategy, helping you prepare for your financial future. </p>
						
						<h3>Growth Potential</h3>
						<p>When planning for your financial future, growth is important. You want your assets to grow so they can keep up with inflation over the long haul. A variable annuity provides the potential for cash accumulation from investment options. </p>
						
						<p>These investment option portfolios are managed by respected names in the mutual fund industry. You have the freedom and flexibility to choose any number and combination of investment options and money managers to suit your goals and risk tolerance — all within the convenience of one product. Of course, investing does include the risk of loss, including principal.</p>
						
						<p>A variable annuity is tax-deferred. This means you do not pay taxes on earnings that accumulate in your policy until you withdraw it. So the money you would have paid in taxes each year continues to work for you.</p>
						
						<h3>Income Source</h3>
						<p>When you are ready, a variable annuity can be converted to a guaranteed stream of income. You can also choose other income options. Only an annuity can provide you with income that’s guaranteed to last as long as you live.</p>
						
						<p>A variable annuity can be a sophisticated financial tool. Working together, you and your financial professional may be able to tailor your policy to help meet your important goals.</p>
						
						<p>For more information about variable annuities, including costs, contact your financial professional who can help you decide if the Ameritas variable annuity, Overture Medley®, is right for you. The product brochure also provides more information.</p>
