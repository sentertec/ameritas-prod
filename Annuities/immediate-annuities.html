						<h2>immediate annuities</h2>
						<p class="sub-title">Income guaranteed for as long as you need it</p>
						<p>Living a long life sounds pretty good, as long as your money lasts as long as you do. An immediate annuity can help by converting a portion of your savings into an income stream that’s guaranteed by Ameritas to last as long as you need it.</p>

						<p>The payment option you choose, your age and the premium you’ve paid will determine how much you will receive and how long it will last. You may want to receive payments for a specific period of time</p>

						<ul>
							<li>to help fill the income gap between early retirement and receiving Social Security benefits, </li>

							<li>to provide extra income during the early, more active years of retirement </li>

							<li>for non-retirement needs, such as providing reliable payments to college students to cover living expenses.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Income Choices</h3>
						<p>You have your choice of an income stream based on your life expectancy or on the life expectancy of you and another person, such as your spouse. You can also choose a payment stream that is guaranteed for a fixed period of time. The payments you receive will be a combination of a return of principal and earnings. If you purchase your immediate annuity with money that has already been taxed, only the earnings you receive will be taxed.</p>

						<p>An immediate annuity might be right for you if you’re looking for a guaranteed stream of income.</p>
