						<h2>history</h2>
						<br/>
						<p class="sub-title">Ameritas Life</p>
						 
						<p>In 1887, there were no local insurance companies in Lincoln, Nebraska. Five local businessmen saw that as an opportunity, and on April 6, 1887, The Old Line Bankers Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (Bankers Life) was formed.</p>
						 
						<p>During the first half of the 20th century Bankers Life grew from a small company serving a limited Midwest geographical area to one of the nation’s 100 largest insurance companies with operations extending to both coasts.</p>
						 
						<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, subsidiaries were formed to offer and underwrite variable insurance products; security and investment products; and dental insurance, individual and low-load life insurance and annuity products in New York.</p>
						 
						<p>In 1988, Bankers Life changed its name to Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. (Ameritas Life) to reflect its broad product line and national scope. The American bison was chosen as the new logo. A widely recognized image, it suggests strength and represents a Midwestern heritage and work ethic.</p>
						 
						<p> In 1998, Ameritas Mutual Insurance Holding Company was formed, then merged in 1999 with Acacia Mutual Holding Corporation to form Ameritas Acacia Mutual Holding Company (The Ameritas Acacia Companies)—the first ever merger of two mutual holding companies.</p>
						 
						<p>In 2006, Ameritas Acacia Mutual Holding Company merged with Union Central Mutual Holding Company and was renamed UNIFI Mutual Holding Company.</p>
						 
						<p>In 2012, UNIFI Mutual Holding Company changed its name to Ameritas Mutual Holding Company. That same year, Ameritas modernized its bison logo and adopted the "fulfilling life" tagline. In 2014, Acacia Life and Union Central Life merged into Ameritas Life.</p>
						 <hr/>						 
						<p class="sub-title">Ameritas Life of New York</p>
						 
						<p>For more than a quarter of a century, Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York (Ameritas Life of NY) has been committed to providing insurance products and services to the New York market.</p>
						 
						<p>Bankers Assurance Company of New York was incorporated to sell dental insurance products in New York in 1984. In 1988, after Bankers Life Nebraska changed its name to Ameritas to reflect its expansion within the broader financial services industry, the Ameritas name also was added in New York, creating Ameritas Bankers Assurance Company of New York.</p>
						 
						<p>In 1994, First Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York (First Ameritas Life) was created to offer individual products exclusively in New York. Ameritas Bankers Assurance Company of New York merged with First Ameritas Life in 1996 to offer individual and group policies. First Ameritas Life joined the Life Insurance Council of New York (LICONY) three years later.</p>
						 
						<p>In 2006, Standard & Poor’s and A.M. Best established a group rating for Ameritas Life Insurance Corp., First Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York, Acacia Life Insurance Company and The Union Central Life Insurance Company. That same year, a whole life policy, written on First Ameritas Life paper, was introduced in New York.</p>
						 
						<p>By approval of mutual holding company members, in 2010 eligible First Ameritas Life policyholders became members of Ameritas Mutual Holding Company, formerly UNIFI Mutual Holding Company.</p>
						 
						<p>First Ameritas Life changed its name to Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York in 2011 and moved its office to New York City.</p>
