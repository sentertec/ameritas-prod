						<h2>commerical mortgage</h2>
						<p class="sub-title">focus on return <em>of</em> capital, not simply return <em>on</em> capital</p>
						<h3>Mission</h3>
						<p>Ameritas Investment Partners Commercial Mortgage and Real Estate Group invest client funds in high quality commercial mortgage loans and in risk appropriate equity real estate investments. Our objective for mortgage loan clients is to provide diversified and balanced portfolios that will give our clients attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our objective for equity real estate is to invest our clientsâ€™ capital in commercial real estate that will maximize cash flow and capital appreciation for the client.</p>
						
						<h3>Products &amp; Services</h3>
						<p>The Commercial Mortgage and Real Estate Group offers the combination of long-term, fixed-rate financing and a user-friendly delivery process. Our interest rates are competitive, but most of our success is because of our process in committing, closing and servicing loans. We market our reputation as a fair, honest, open and flexible source of real estate loans, and have benefited by obtaining yield spreads above industry standards.</p>
						<p>We employ a conservative management style which emphasizes self-amortizing mortgages. This approach aligns the interests of the borrower with those of the client/lender. Return of, rather than simple return on capital is paramount.</p>
						<p>Over the last seven years, we have originated over $2.1 billion in commercial mortgages for our clients. These investments are secured by office buildings, warehouses, apartment communities, hotels and retail centers located throughout the United States. This strategy of diversification produces a well-balanced portfolio resistant to economic and real estate risks.</p>
						
						<h3>Strengths</h3>
						<p>Our greatest strength is our people. We have a core group of seasoned professionals with an excellent reputation for providing our clients with mortgage investments which satisfy their parameters of size, price, location, borrower and property quality. Our results bear this out. We have built and managed client portfolios appropriately diversified geographically and by property type, providing above-market yields and problem loan levels which are but a small fraction of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) industry averages.</p>
						<p>We market our mortgage program through a national network of carefully selected mortgage banking intermediaries. These long established relationships have provided us with mortgage opportunities throughout the country and on a wide variety of property types. These firms provide us with local market expertise to augment our own seasoned real estate professionals.</p>
