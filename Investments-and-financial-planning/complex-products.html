						<h2>complex products</h2>
						<p>Complex products is a relatively new term applied to several categories of investments that provide an opportunity for less traditional investing.   The name comes from the fact that they are more difficult to understand in terms of interaction as market conditions change, how the interaction might affect potential risk and return, and the often complicated expenses associated with the investment.</p>
						<p>At Ameritas Investment Corp (AIC), we group our complex products into three categories:  alternative products, variable annuities and structured products.</p>
						
						<h3>Alternative Products</h3>
						
						<p>If you are an experienced investor and looking for other options for your investments, something other than the more established and popular investment vehicles, alternative products may be of interest.  Among the AIC alternative products are:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Non-traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT):  a corporation, trust or association that owns (and might also manage) income-producing real estate issues notes.  REITs pool the capital of multiple investors to purchase a portfolio of properties that the typical investor might not otherwise be able to purchase individually.  As the name states, REITs do not trade on a national securities exchange.</li>
							<li>Oil and gas royalties: private offerings of oil and gas drilling ventures for which an investor may realize a share of the profits if/when the venture is successful.</li>
							<li>Equipment leasing:  equipment leasing programs offer the potential for a highly competitive fixed income stream earned from the financing/leasing of equipment ranging from technology to medical and manufacturing equipment.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>While alternative products provide opportunity for significant asset growth and income and some tax benefits, they also involve risk.  There is no guarantee of return on the investment.  Depending upon the type of alternative product, the risks will be unique to that investment but may include:  no liquidity, complexity/difficulty in determining the real value of the investment over time, restrictive and expensive early redemption, outside effects on markets/pricing, and insufficient knowledge of business strength of company seeking capital.</p>
						
						<h3>Variable Annuities</h3>
						
						<p>Variable annuities can be an integral part of your long-term retirement planning strategy, helping overcome risks and provide important optional benefits to help protect your financial future.  Variable annuities offer professionally managed investment options, guaranteed death benefits and payment options to help your clients meet their retirement income needs.</p>
						
						<p>You should always read the prospectus before investing to make sure you understand the risk and charges involved.</p>
						
						<h3>Structured Products</h3>
						
						<p>Structured products are innovative investment vehicles (debt security) normally linked to the performance of an underlying asset, or assets, such as an equity, index, foreign exchange, commodity or some combination of securities.  They can be customized and individually built/created/structured, with help from your financial advisor, to take advantage of current market conditions or to hedge an investment risk.  Structured products do not represent ownership of a portfolio of assets but are promises to pay from the product issuers.</p>
						
						<p>AIC offers two types of structured products:  certificates of deposit and bonds.  Every structured product is somewhat different; therefore, features vary widely and may not be applicable to every structured product.</p>
