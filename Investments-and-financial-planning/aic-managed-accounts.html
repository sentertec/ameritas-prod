						<p>Financial planning is a process of setting long and short-term financial goals, providing direction for fulfilling the financial future you desire, and giving meaning to financial decisions along the way.</p>
						
						<p>Working with your Ameritas Investment Corp. (AIC) financial advisor, you are able to select from a wide range of investment programs and options within the programs. In turn, your financial advisor works with a team of experienced investment managers, portfolio designers, market analysts who monitor your investments, and strategists who recommend adjustments to your investment strategy over time.  A team of select market researchers backs these professionals.</p>
						
						<p>Managed accounts are an investment advisory service provided by AIC. This service is particularly attractive to investors who have neither the time nor expertise for financial planning on their own.</p>
						
						<p>An example of an entry level managed investment program offered by AIC is called Constellation.  It features six professionally managed investment portfolios (strategies) designed to fit a range of investor profiles from conservative (less prone to risk) to aggressive (more prone to risk).</p>
						
						<br/>
						
						<p>Investors normally appreciate the following features of managed accounts:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Combine the services of a professional portfolio manager and the brokerage firm</li>
							<li>Decisions are based on the investor’s goals, risk tolerance and time frame for generating growth</li>
							<li>Choice of program portfolios include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, UITs, CDs, no-load variable annuities, cash equivalents or a combination of investments</li>
							<li>Investor strategies are continually monitored and adjusted when necessary to maintain balance among types of investments</li>
							<li>Sometimes called a wrap account, all fees and expenses associated with the investment are “wrapped” into a single annual charge.  This includes brokerage commissions, management fees, and administrative costs.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>As an individual investor, you also have online account access on your computer, tablet or smartphone 24 hours/day through MyStreetscape.</p>
						
						<h3>Wealth Management</h3>
						<p>Wealth Management is an extension of financial planning.  Financial Planning at this higher investment level includes expertise in the following strategies:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Long-term investment management</li>
							<li>Tax efficiency - the portfolio is managed to minimize tax impact while seeking to maximize performance in line with the investor’s needs</li>
							<li>Current income management</li>
							<li>Estate planning</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Your AIC financial advisor works with a team of professional financial experts to customize an individual portfolio to help you reach specific financial goals and objectives.  Two Wealth Management programs are available through your AIC financial planner:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>MERCURY utilizes Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) to diversify among asset classes for your customized portfolio.  This program is designed for accounts of $100,00 and above.</li>
							<li>GEMINI has the added capability to create a customized, tax efficient portfolio utilizing individual securities in certain asset classes and completing the asset allocation process by investing in ETFs.  This program is designed for accounts of $500,000 and above.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Like other managed accounts through AIC, these programs combine several services into one comprehensive program for a single fee based on assets in the account.  The services include an investor needs evaluation, investment asset allocation and planning, professional portfolio management, and performance measurement and reporting.  Transaction and custody costs for securities in the portfolio are also included in the fee.</p>
