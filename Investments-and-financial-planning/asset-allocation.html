						<h2>asset allocation</h2>
						
						<h3>Combining knowledge and experience to help you find investment solutions in a complex world</h3>
						
						<p>Asset allocation is a process to divide your portfolio among the major asset classes of bonds, equities, alternative investments, and cash or cash equivalents. Each asset class historically has different levels of risk and return which behave differently over time. By diversifying your money across these asset classes, you may lower your portfolio's overall risk exposure while maintaining your return objectives.</p>
						
						<p>Ameritas Investment Partners (AIP) asset allocation services can be used to develop portfolios for both institutional and retail clients. AIP utilizes a proprietary asset allocation process designed to align client needs, expectations and constraints with investment market opportunities to deliver client-specific custom diversified investment portfolios. </p>
						
						<p>Portfolio managers develop recommendations based on each clientâ€™s investment policies, financial situation, cash flow expectations, risk tolerance, income tax exposure, complementary investment exposure and other factors. Investments are selected that have both attractive expected returns and complementary characteristics when held within a diversified investment portfolio. Periodically and when appropriate, asset allocation models are evaluated and updated. Accordingly we will reallocate investment values for discretionary accounts, and we will update recommendations for non-discretionary accounts. </p>

						<p>Additionally for portfolios that include a portion of actively managed assets, AIP utilizes a combination of multiple account managers for core common stocks and fixed income securities as appropriate with each manager employing their own investment discipline, philosophy, and approach to diversification.</p>
