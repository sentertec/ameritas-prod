						<h3>Philosophy</h3>
						<p>Ameritas Investment Partners Large Cap Growth managers utilize a growth style approach to selecting equities. We focus our attention and research primarily on large U.S. based companies. Our goal is to select stocks of companies with superior earnings potential, strong management, a relatively low debt structure, industry leadership, and trading at reasonable valuations. Our managers strive to identify companies that will be superior performers within their industries well into the future.</p>
						
						<h3>Strategy</h3>
						<p>The investments made for our clients center around a thorough research process. The process involves researching the companies, analyzing their industries, and developing a sound, well thought out basis for making a well-informed investment decision.</p>
						
						<p>We receive real time external research, and discuss the research directly with industry analysts, who provide clarity on their respective recommendations. Complementing that research, our managers may meet with the management teams of candidate investment companies. Our analysis blends all of this information and provides the insights to make quality investment decisions.</p>

						<p>In addition to bottom-up company research, our managers conduct an economic analysis. We apply this information, when appropriate, to optimize company weightings by industry or sector to the most attractive levels based on their economic forecast. The change in weightings does not override the companyâ€™s diversification discipline. Individual company weightings generally range within 1.0% to 5.0% of the benchmark.</p>

						<p>Ameritas Investment Partners managers do not engage in market timing or rely exclusively on technical analysis. We take a long-term perspective when evaluating companies as investments and look for investments that should outperform over time and over the course of business cycles.</p>
