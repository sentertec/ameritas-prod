						<h2>individual securities</h2>
						<p>Some investors may prefer to focus on individual securities, selecting from stocks, bonds, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and fixed income choices such as bonds and certificates of deposit.  Unlike mutual funds and similar pooled investments, the individual investor is making a specific, individual purchase or investment in selected securities. The investor may keep the individual investments separate and manage them independently.  Ameritas Investment Corp offers full broker dealer services and can assist in the purchase, trade and/or investment in individual securities.</p>
						
						<h3>Stocks</h3>
						<p>Stocks are a type of security that gives stockholders a share of ownership in a company.  They may also be called equities.  Some things to remember about stock investments:</p>
						<p>When you buy stock, you become a shareholder or stockholder.  You make money when the stock increases in value or when the company that issued the stock pays dividends, or a part of its profits, to its shareholders.</p>
						
						<h3>Bonds</h3>
						<p>Bonds are debt securities.  Borrowers issue bonds to raise money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of time.  When you buy a bond you are lending to the issuer, which may be a government, municipality, or corporation.  In return, the issuer promises to pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the principal, also known as face value or par value of the bond, when it “matures,” or comes due after a set period of time.</p>
						<p>Bonds may provide regular income or help diversity a portfolio; although, there are credit and liquidity risks associated with bond investments.  Inflation may erode the purchasing power of interest income and economic changes may limit a company’s ability to make interest or principal payments.</p>
						
						<h3>Exchange-Traded Funds</h3>
						<p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are designed as an efficient and simple way for investors to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day.  In other words, ETFs are built like an index fund but trade like a stock.  They provide investors the advantages of lower costs and improved tax efficiency over traditional, actively-managed mutual funds.</p>
						
						<h3>Fixed Income</h3>
						<p>Among the best known of fixed income investments are bonds and certificates of deposit.</p>
						<p>As stated above, corporations, treasury securities (T-bills), governments and municipalities issue bonds to raise funds, and in return pay the bond owners a fixed interest rate on the money that has been loaned to them.</p>
						<p>A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings account that holds a fixed amount of money for a fixed period of time and, in exchange, pays interest.</p>
						<p>A portfolio containing a significant portion of fixed income investments may not provide the protection an investor needs to fight the effects of inflation because the rate of return for fixed income investments is historically lower over the long term than the return of equity investments.  Fixed income securities do, however, provide the diversification needed to maintain a well-balanced investment portfolio.</p>
