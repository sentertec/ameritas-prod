										<h3>Traditional Tailored Indemnity</h3>
										<p>We offer a full line of traditional indemnity dental products that are made to order. Providing dental benefits for a wide range of needs is something we’re really good at. We specialize in it. And since customer needs always come first, that makes for a great fit.</p>
										
										<h3>Value Source<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>We think quality dental plans should be affordable. That’s why we offer Value Source, a plan that provides quality benefits at a reasonable price. With a combination of traditional benefits and savvy cost controls, we’ll help keep expenses in check.<p>

										<h3>EssentialDental<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>With coverage options that center around good dental care basics, EssentialDental is designed to keep smiles healthy and costs low.</p>
										
										<h3>Managed Care/Provider From Our Network</h3>
										<p>Our managed care dental products help to balance cost and member choice by tailoring a plan that fulfills your specific needs.</p>
										
										<h3>Dental Rewards<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>Wouldn’t it be great if members were rewarded for practicing good oral wellness? With Dental Reward’s increasing annual maximum feature, they are. Members who don’t use much of their annual max can qualify to carry some of those unused dollars forward for use in future years. That way, the money is there when they need it most.</p>
										
										<h3>Orthodontia</h3>
										<p>We offer orthodontic benefits for children and adults. Add this feature to enhance your benefit package, and unleash the power of a great smile. Beautiful smiles and happy faces lead to achieving great things by our members at work and in life.  </p>
										
										<h3>Cosmetic</h3>
										<p>Today’s consumer wants to look good and feel good. Include teeth whitening (bleaching) and tooth-color composites on molars with your dental plan. Plan members and their loved ones will thank you.</p>
										
										<h3>High/Low</h3>
										<p>These voluntary plans offer members two dental procedure reimbursement levels with two corresponding premiums (high or low). All in one policy. Now that’s flexible.</p>
										
										<h3>Core/Buy-up</h3>
										<p>Consider funding a core benefit with the option of buying up to a richer benefit. This way, employers can offer a base benefit, and plan members who want more can have it.</p>
										
										<h3>Dual Choice Option</h3>
										<p>We’ve been in the business of providing quality group benefits long enough to know that people have different needs. Our dual option plans give employers the freedom to offer members one plan with two choices. That way, they can choose the right coverage at the right price.</p>
										
										<h3>$ensible Choice<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>$ensible Choice bases reimbursement on the dollar amount of your plan member's expense for dental care -- not on benefit types or procedure categories.  And, depending on your needs and goals, ASO and qualifying fully insured groups can choose whether to include a set of smart cost management tools that help keep benefit costs predictable and rates stable.</p>
										
										<h3>Voluntary</h3>
										<p>An employer doesn’t need a lot of money to provide competitive benefits. With our voluntary plans, they can offer cost-effective benefits while members choose individually whether to participate and cover the costs.</p>
										
										<h3>ASO Administrative Services Only</h3>
										<p>We’re here to help make your life easier. We provide simplicity to for your self-funded benefit plans.  As members’ claims come to us for processing, we pay the claims and then notify the employer of the cost each week.  We’ve got you covered, one claim at a time.</p>
										
										<h3>Small Group Trust</h3>
										<p>We employ small group managers specifically for fulfilling the needs of smaller organizations. Wellness benefits such as dental and vision are not just for big corporations. Local family businesses and smaller groups need them too, and we’re here to help.</p>

										<h3>Vision Perfect<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>We understand that when it comes to benefits, surprises are a bad thing. That's why we offer Vision Perfect. This plan is based on a schedule of benefits, so members will know exactly what's covered and what to expect. The plan also offers increasing annual benefits so members have more benefit dollars each year on the plan.</p>

										<h3>Focus<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>We do everything in our power to make sure you and your employees are satisfied. That includes offering Focus, our vision plans featuring the VSP<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup> Signature and Choice networks. Choose a VSP vision provider for network savings and satisfaction.</p>

										<h3>ViewPointe<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>Choice is a wonderful thing. So we created a complete vision portfolio that also features the EyeMed Vision Care Access and Select nationwide vision provider networks. See what plan works best to fulfill your needs.</p>

										<h3>Exam or Materials Only</h3>
										<p>What if an employer already has a vision benefit, and just needs a little something to complement it? We offer vision exam only and vision materials only plans to fill these needs.</p>

										<h3>LASIK Advantage<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>With LASIK Advantage, members can get benefits for a number of popular, well-established laser vision correction procedures. Benefits increase over time and can be added to virtually all of our dental and vision plans.</p>

										<h3>High/Low</h3>
										<p>These voluntary plans offer members two dental procedure reimbursement levels with two corresponding premiums (high or low). All in one policy. Nice!</p>

										<h3>Core/Buy-up</h3>
										<p>Consider funding a core benefit with the option of buying up to a richer benefit. This way, employers can offer a base benefit, and plan members who want more can have it.</p>

										<h3>Dual or Triple Choice</h3>
										<p>We offer dual and triple choice vision plans, allowing employers the option to select multiple vision products for members to choose from. There’s Vision Perfect, our own no-network reimbursement plan; Focus, featuring the VSP network; and ViewPointe, featuring the EyeMed network.</p>

										<h3>Administrative Services Only</h3>
										<p>We keep things simple with your self-funded benefit plan. The same outstanding products and services that are available to our fully insured customers also are available to you on a per-capita basis. You pay the claims and leave the admin work to us.</p>

										<h3>Voluntary</h3>
										<p>Are benefit dollars tight? With our voluntary plans, the employer provides the vision benefit and members voluntarily sign up and pay for it.</p>

										<h3>EyeChoice<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup></h3>
										<p>Here we’ve got one brochure that includes our most popular vision plans, including rates. Choose from Vision Perfect, Focus or ViewPointe benefits. This brochure is a must see, full of our top plans.</p>

										<h3>My Dental Plan<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup> and 20/20 Plus<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup>  </h3>
										<p>Our individual plans help individuals and their families keep their smiles and vision healthy. Since coverage is not tied to a group plan (such as through an employer), people can count on their protection regardless of employment status, retirement or age. For added value, members also receive savings on medical prescriptions at Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies nationwide.</p>

										<p>Those who can benefit from our individual plans include people who have no employer-sponsored coverage, such as seasonal and part-time workers or those entering retirement; membership organizations ineligible for group coverage; and people who are self-employed. The My Dental Plan and 20/20 Plus include three plan options so individuals can select what works best for their dental and vision health needs. Please Note: 20/20 Plus Plans are not available in New York. Plans are insured by Ameritas. Individual plans are administered by HealthPlan Services.<br/>

										<h3>Edge Dental, Vision</h3>
										<p>Based on our Ameritas dental and vision benefit plans, these offerings were designed especially for the Brokers National Life Assurance Company (BNL) producers/brokers who joined Ameritas in 2012. These plans include the best of Ameritas’ group and individual dental and vision plan options.</p>

										<p>To ease the transition from BNL to Ameritas, we decided to call these plans the Edge series. But it’s still Ameritas, and customers get everything they’ve come to expect from Ameritas, including the flexible plan designs and customer service excellence we’re famous for.</p>
