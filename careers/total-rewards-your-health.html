						<h2>your health &amp; well-being</h2>
						
						<p>On a daily basis, we make choices for those we hold closest. Those choices can sometimes involve risk and uncertainty. Choosing the road or means by which we maintain and ensure the health of ourselves and our families is an important decision. Ameritas strives to provide multiple options to fit the needs of our diverse population of associates.</p>

						<p>It's simple - we help keep you health - you help keep us strong.</p>

						<h2>health and welfare benefits</h2>

						<p><h3>Medical</h3>At Ameritas, we understand that the same option doesn't necessarily work well for everyone, so we offer you choices. There are two health plans for you to choose from: Standard and High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). With these options, you can choose the one that works best for your family.</p>

						<p><h3>Dental and Vision</h3>Comprehensive coverage provided by Ameritas Dental and Vision Service Plan (VSP) including Lasik and Hearing Benefits. These plans help you afford proper preventative and diagnostic care.</p>

						<p><h3>Healthy Pregnancy Programs</h3>
						Enrolled associates receive educational information and the support they need to make the best choices for their well-being and that of the baby. Special incentives are offered for adhering to the programs guidelines through the end of the pregnancy.</p>

						<p><h3>Flexible Spending Accounts</h3>
						FSAs help you manage your out-of-pocket expenses by allowing you to set aside money from your pay (tax free) to help pay for eligible healthcare and dependent care. We make it even easier by offering a debit card for the healthcare expenses.</p>

						<p><h3>Domestic Partner Benefits</h3>Non-traditional family units are recognized under the health plan and when enrolled, medical benefits provided to meet their needs.</p>

						<p><h3>Tobacco-Free Workplace</h3>
						Ameritas is committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for our associates, customers and visitors as well as promoting the health and well-being of our associates. To contribute to this, Ameritas is a Tobacco-Free Workplace. We believe that being tobacco-free is the right thing to do to help ensure the health and wellness of our most valuable asset - our people.</p>

						<h2>work-life benefits</h2>

						<p><h3>Paid Time Off (PTO) and Holidays</h3>Work-life balance is crucial for professional success and endurance. We know that your job satisfaction hinges on a good balance. Our Ameritas policies encourage you to get away and enjoy life.</p>

						<p><h3>Leaves of Absence</h3>A variety of leaves (military, civil, adoption, parental/elder care, etc.) ensure that you have the flexibility to pursue those life events that are meaningful to you.</p>

						<p><h3>New Parent Leave</h3>Ameritas recognizes the benefit of supporting new mothers and fathers following the birth of a child/children with time off to care for, bond or arrange for the welfare of the child/children or to handle other family matters. Additional leave may be available under other leave provisions.</p>

						<p><h3>Employee Assistance Program</h3>Life happens. This confidential service provides professional counseling services to help you and your family better manage your health and life. </p>

						<p><h3>Wellness Programs</h3>Annual health risk assessments, health fairs, flu vaccinations, blood pressure management, Weight Watcher's at work programs, chair massages and ergonomic work station setup are offered to enhance your personal well-being. Discounts and incentive bonuses are offered throughout many of these programs to keep associates on track &#38; successful.</p>

						<p><h3>Fitness</h3>Fitness reimbursement program, on site fitness centers (available in many locations), Unified Strides walking program, and discounts to local health and fitness facilities provides you the support and flexibility for you to stay active.</p>

						<p><h3>Alternative Work Schedules</h3>To accommodate and reflect individuals needs and preferences, we offer telecommuting, part-time, flextime, compressed work weeks and varied starting and ending work hours, as business needs allow.</p>
