						<p class="sub-title">You work for the future &mdash; yours or those you care about</p>
						
						<p>Occasionally, we face risk and uncertainty.  Ameritas coordinates with our partners to ensure that we have accounted for most of those uncertainties – allowing you to be prepared.</p>
						
						<p>It’s simple – we give you choices for security…you give us the opportunity to give that to our customers.</p>
						
						<h3>The Here and Now - Your Financial Security</h3>

						<div class="row">
											
							<div class="col-sm-8">
									<p>What would you do if you couldn’t earn a living?  Disability is a genuine concern, yet only a small portion of U.S. workers have access to Disability Insurance. Ameritas not only provides these valuable benefits, but, pays a significant portion of those benefits.  It’s okay – we’ve got you covered.</p>

						</div>
						
					
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Short-Term Disability</strong><br/>
							For life’s unexpected speed bumps, we provide short-term disability benefits.  Through this program, you are eligible to receive income protection in the event of a qualifying illness or non-work related injury.</li>
							<li><strong>Long-Term Disability</strong><br/>
							Occasionally, some situations require a longer recovery period, and we want to ensure our associates have peace of mind during their healing.  This program allows eligible participants to receive income protection in the event of a qualifying illness or non-work related injury.</li>
							<li><strong>Long Term Care</strong><br/>
							This voluntary benefit provides a protection against the financial risks associated with daily living due to an accident, illness or advancing age.</li>
							<li><strong>Group Life and Optional Accidental Death & Dismemberment Insurance</strong><br/>
							Take comfort in knowing that your family is protected.  Our group life insurance program means one less worry.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Your Future – Financial Planning & Protection</h3>

									<p>Saving for the future requires a plan.  Ameritas provides planning tools, plus motivating tips and information.  Whether you are just starting out, on the road, or nearing your retirement goal.  Videos, iCharts, tutorials, calculators and other tools are available to you.</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Retirement Savings Plan</strong><br/>
							We offer a 401(k) plan with a 50% match of your contributions to a maximum of 3% of your eligible earnings.  Additionally, Ameritas will make a quarterly contribution of 5% of your eligible earnings regardless of whether or not you contribute.</li>
							<li><strong>Financial Education</strong><br/>
							Workshops and seminars on budgeting, managing your personal portfolio and planning for your future are available throughout the year to help you.</li>
							
							<li><strong>Travel Accident Insurance</strong><br/>
