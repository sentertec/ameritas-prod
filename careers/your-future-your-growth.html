						<p>Great leaders are people who lead by example, regardless of their title, and possess the skills to mediate, negotiate and motivate others in any setting.  It’s a chance to get re-energized and build new relationships with others – inside and outside of the organization.  Ongoing growth and development is a demonstration of the desire to build and grow potential – personally and organizationally.</p>
