						<h2>internships and college recruiting</h2>
						
						<p class="sub-title">Our people are our future</p>
						
						<p>And we strive to bring the future to us.  We believe in providing learning opportunities to introduce talented individuals to our businesses and culture.  Internships are an essential element of our future.  They provide the opportunity for us to recruit and develop the best candidates to support our mission, vision and values.</p>
						 
						<p>Our emphasis is in identifying candidates early in their college career for internships and potentially for full-time, long term careers following graduation.</p>

						<p>The purpose of an internship is not about what Ameritas can get from it. Internships provide students an opportunity to confirm their chosen career goals, and an opportunity to start their future early. Below are a few of our own associates that began their career path as an intern at Ameritas. See what they have to say about their experience with Ameritas.</p>

											<h3>Job Fit</h3>
											<p>as you decide that you want to pursue a career in a particular field, you won't know until you actually try the job. Internships give you the real life experience that can reinforce the passion you believe you have, or it will help avoid years of training for the wrong career area.</p>
											 
											<h3>Essential Experience</h3>
											<p> having an internship on your resume can improve the likelihood of an interview. Employers like to see that you have some hands on experience. Even if it is a short term opportunity, its a critical piece of succeeding in your chosen career field.</p>
											 
											<h3>Networking</h3>
											<p>the greatest resource we have are the experienced professionals that are willing to share their knowledge with the next generation. Some information simply can't be learned from a book.</p>
											 
											<h3>College Credit or Certification</h3>
											<p>many programs offer college credit or program certification for internships.</p>
											 
											<h3>Post Graduation Employment</h3>
											<p>"Employers say they extended job offers to nearly 70 percent of their interns last year...", Marilyn Mackes, National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE).</p>

										<p>Ameritas offers different types of internships, depending on the needs of the different lines of business. Our goal is to provide varying avenues of learning opportunities, not just for interns, but, the potential of identifying future associates.  Ameritas opportunities include:</p>
										 
										<h3>Rotational Internship</h3>
										<p>Our rotational internships are generally 18 - 24 months in length and focus on students going into their junior year of college.  These internships will focus on a specific job function within different lines of business (finance, legal, marketing, etc.). With exposure to different areas, the program prepares students for increasing responsibility through a combination of rotational assignments, structured learning, formalized feedback and mentoring. Interns have the benefit of interaction with senior leaders and participate in various key initiatives in different areas.</p>
										 
										<h3>Summer Internship</h3>
										<p>Unique, short term opportunities to reinforce your career direction.</p>
										 
										<h3>Project Internship</h3>
										<p>Internships can provide the foundation for a future career with the organization, especially as projects evolve and become important.  Various projects throughout the organization, specifically in our areas of Shared Services (accounting, project management, information technology, human resources, etc.) provide students with specific, career focused experience to support the creation, implementation and establishment of ongoing projects and objectives.</p>
