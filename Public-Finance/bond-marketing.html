						<h2>bond marketing</h2>
						
						<p>Underwriting is part one of the process for issuing bonds.  Part two is bond marketing.  Ameritas Investment Corp. has a highly qualified marketing team to manage the bond selling/purchasing process in the marketplace, helping to assure the bond issuer that the needed capital will be delivered.  Three key functions within AIC contribute to its bond marketing expertise.</p>
						
						<h3>Trade Desk</h3>
						<p>The AIC trade desk determines the interest rate on bonds issued.  The decision-making process includes careful evaluation of the financial needs of both the issuer and the investor who will purchase the bond.  Our traders are in continuous contact with retail and institutional investors and regional and national trading desks.  The on-going communication and information shared helps create an economic benefit for our clients by providing cost-effective financing under any market conditions.</p>
						 
						<h3>Sales Desk</h3>
						<p>AIC wants its clients to have the broadest possible market for their bonds.  Therefore, we maintain relationships with institutional buyers nationwide as well as a strong retail marketing presence. Our leadership in underwriting bonds often encourages individual investors to approach Ameritas Investment Corp. when they want to purchase bonds. Diversity in buyers is advantageous to efficient bond selling.  </p>
						 
						<h3>Administrative Support</h3>
						<p>Bond issues and other public finance transactions are closely scrutinized and highly regulated.  It is crucial that we focus total attention on the details and provide needed support throughout the marketing process.  Our experienced administrative staff works with our underwriters and customers to provide the quality of support needed for this essential function, reducing the time and effort required from the issuer.</p>
