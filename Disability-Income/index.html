						<h2>disability income insurance</h2>
						
						<p class="sub-title">Protection for your most valuable asset</p>
						<p>The ability to work and earn a living makes everything else possible. It’s our most valuable asset. And it deserves protection. Our income earning potential can be protected with disability income insurance. Disability income insurance provides income if you are unable to work because of an illness or injury.</p>
						
						<h3>Reasons Can Be Surprising</h3>
						<p>No one expects a serious injury or illness to strike but disability can happen to anyone at any time. Disabilities are not usually the result of an accident. The four most common causes of existing long term disability claims in 2012* were:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases  (30.7%)</li>
							<li>nervous system and sense organs diseases (14.2%)</li>
							<li>circulatory system diseases (12.1%)</li>
							<li>cancer (9.0%)</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Are Other Options Enough?</h3>
						<p>If you have group long-term disability insurance through your employer, that’s a valuable foundation and a good start. But income from group long-term disability insurance is taxable and is sometimes not enough. Individual disability income insurance fills in the gaps. And you own the policy. It’s yours to keep whether you change employers or not.</p>
						<p>You don’t hesitate to insure your home, your car or other valuables, so why wouldn’t you protect your income? Think of it as insurance for your paycheck. Contact an insurance professional to learn more about protecting your earning potential.</p>
