						<h2>DInamic Fundamental</h2>

						<p class="sub-title">Protect your income </p>
						<p>Disability income insurance protects your most valuable asset—your income—if you become too sick or hurt to work. DInamic Fundamental® is a simple, affordable and attainable product for your disability income insurance needs.</p>

						<h3>Simple to Understand</h3>
						<p>If you’re unable to perform the major duties of your job (or a similar job) and the disability is expected to last at least a year, you will receive a lump sum payment—usually about a month after the disability.* It’s that simple.</p>

						<h3>Affordable Protection</h3>
						<p>If you’ve thought that DI insurance was out of reach, we’ve got good news. DInamic Fundamental® is affordable with a stable monthly premium based on the percentage of manual duties in your job. The premium is comparable to other household bills such as internet service, cable TV etc.</p>
						
						<h3>Attainable Coverage</h3>
						<p>A short, simple application and simplified underwriting process make it easier to qualify for DInamic Fundamental® than some other disability insurance products. To be considered, you must work at least 30 hours a week and cannot be employed in a medical or high-risk occupation.</p>
						
						<p>You don’t hesitate to insure your home, your car or other valuables, so why wouldn’t you protect your earning potential? Think of it as insurance for your paycheck. Review the brochure below or contact an insurance professional to learn more about protecting your earning potential.</p>

						<hr/>
						<p>*If you’re unable to perform the material and substantial duties of any occupation for which you are reasonable suited based on your education, training, and experience and the disability is expected to last at least 365 days, you are guaranteed to receive a lump sum payment after a 30 day survival period from the date of disability.</p>
						
						<p>In approved states, DInamic Fundamental® (form 4504LS) is issued by Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. In New York, DInamic Fundamental® (form 5504-LS) is issued by Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York. Policy may vary and may not be available in all states.</p>
