						<h2>grow your business</h2>

						<p>As a business owner, you know that a growing business is a successful business. And often times, you're so involved in the day-to-day operations, you don't invest the time you need in developing a business strategy - a plan to truly grow the business you've created.</p>

						<p>First, do you know your mission? A mission statement may sound cliche, but it's vital to create one and follow it. Every. Single Day.</p>

						<p>Second, it's so important to get the basic structure of your business right. Look to developing partners and relationships with contractors and suppliers that can best service your business needs.</p>

						<p>Third, make sure you have the right people in key leadership roles. Many times, the success or failure of a small business hinges on the fact they don't identify team members who share the same passion and goals. Sometimes, the hardest thing (but often the right decision) is to part company with senior managers who are unable to help you achieve your business goals.</p>

						<p>Fourth, ensure you have a strong purpose and set of ethics. It may sound simple, but having this at your business' core resonates with both your employees and your customers.</p>

						<p>Fifth. Details. As we hear so often, the devil is in the details. Taking time to do the little things can often times mean the difference between building a business and simply surviving.</p>

						<p>Finally, listen to your customers and respond whenever you can. More and more, the customer has the power to make your business succeed or fail. Take the time to listen and react. This will pay dividends long into the future.</p>

						<p>At Ameritas, we are committed to helping you grow your business. From retirement plans to group dental, vision and hearing care, we can help.</p>
